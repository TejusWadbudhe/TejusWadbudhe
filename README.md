# Hi, I'm Tejus 

<img src="https://github.com/TejusWadbudhe/TejusWadbudhe/blob/master/HeaderPic.png">
I am an Augmented Reality developer. I help people to become the best version of themselves so that they can make better decisions in their lifes and we can together make a better world. I started programming at the age of 16 and found it more fascinating than to sit and watch Ben 10 all the time. So, I started learning about different technologies. After trying and quitting many technologies I found AR-MR. I am no expert, just a guy figuring out his way.
